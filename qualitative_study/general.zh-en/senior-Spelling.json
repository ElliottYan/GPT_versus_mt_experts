        "hyp": "文 3 : An articled published in the Billboard in August 2021 noted: The fans of BTS exploited an advantage concerning the billboard \"in an aboveboard way\" to promote the rankings of BTS's singles including Butter in the United States, listing them in the first group of the Top 100 for weeks. Although the list of Top 100 Singles usually depends on the streaming media and amount of playing, the ranking of Butter is primarily based on the sales (mostly via BTS's online store, which, different from iTunes, allows fans to purchase multiple copies of a song) and fan-led crowdfunding activities (including using fund raised from global fans to make purchases that are only taken into account in American sales via PayPal and the like services). But an article published in The Korea Times refuted the allegation of billboard manipulation, arguing that the fans of other singers, including Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, had also taken the similar promotional measures, which were neither illegal nor immoral, and that these fans are simply \"intelligent-device-based consumers that lead a global trend\".",
