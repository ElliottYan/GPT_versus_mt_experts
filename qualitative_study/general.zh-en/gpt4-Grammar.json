During the match against Oarai Girls Academy, her panicked and flustered behavior disrupted her teammates' morale. She attempted to exploit a loophole in the rules by secretly using a spy balloon to eavesdrop on the enemy, but this backfired, leading to a loss of advantage and ultimately defeat for her team. She was also punished by Kay. When she's upset or angry, she inexplicably mentions her secret crush on a boy named A-Xiao. In the movie, she is comforted by the Rabbit Team for this reason. Although she's sharp-tongued and full of cunning ideas, at heart she's a simple and somewhat silly girl with a rich personality.
