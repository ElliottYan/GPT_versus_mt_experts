However, Soviet intelligence agencies overestimated the armored strength of the German 3rd Panzer Army at this time. As a result, Konev launched a full-scale attack and a tank brigade under the Soviet 20th Tank Corps brought the novel Joseph Stalin heavy tanks to the Korsun battlefield. Konev ordered all available armored vehicles and artillery to open fire on the breakout forces, cutting off the isolated enemies and dispersing them. The two Soviet infantry divisions responsible for blocking, the 206th Sniper Division and the 5th Guards Airborne Division, were defeated by the German breakout forces. Without support from the infantry, the Soviet tanks were forced to engage the breakout German troops from a distance. Since there were no anti-tank weapons on the battlefield, T-34 tanks charged into the unprotected German positions, attacking headquarters units, stragglers, and medics.",
