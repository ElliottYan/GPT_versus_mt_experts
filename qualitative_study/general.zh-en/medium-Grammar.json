She is a sophomore at the Saunders University High School and her first appearance is in Episode 4 of this season. She is good at planning tactics and is the military advisor of the team. However, she is easy to get emotional and nervous in tank competitions. When her team was competing with the Oarai Girls' Academy's team, her flurried and dejected behavior affected the morale of other teammates. She took advantage of a rule loophole and secretly used a spy balloon to eavesdrop on intelligence. However, she was beaten back by a counter-blow, which resulted in the team's loss of advantages and the final defeat. Because of the cheat, she was punished by Kay. When she is sad or angry, she will inexplicably mention the boy (called Takashi) she has a crush on. In the film adaptation, she was consoled by the Rabbit Team for this reason. Despite her usual sharp tongue and bad ideas, she is inherently simple-minded and is merely a somewhat silly girl with a complex personality. In Episode 3 of the final season, she fell into a trap planned by the Continuation High School, and thus, the flag tank she was commanding was destroyed.",

While the chart performance of singles on the Hot 100 typically depends on streaming and airplay, that of “Butter” was notably driven mostly by sales (the bulk of which came from BTS’ webstore, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and by fan-led crowdfunding efforts (including using money collected from fans worldwide on services like PayPal to make purchases that count toward US sales only). However, an article in The Korea Times pushed back against claims of chart manipulation. It opined that fanbases of other artists such as Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande have employed similar promotional measures, that such measures were neither illegal nor unethical, and that fans engaging in those measures were merely “intelligent consumers leading global trends”.",
