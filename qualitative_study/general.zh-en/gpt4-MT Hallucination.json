        "hyp": "文 3 : The M4 Sherman (76mm turret variant) tank commander and radio operator (deputy team leader) is a second-year student at Saunders University High School. She first appeared in episode 4 of the series and is skilled at devising various tactics, serving as the team's strategist. However, she becomes very emotional and nervous during tankery matches. During the match against Oarai Girls Academy, her panicked and flustered behavior disrupted her teammates' morale. She attempted to exploit a loophole in the rules by secretly using a spy balloon to eavesdrop on the enemy, but this backfired, leading to a loss of advantage and ultimately defeat for her team. She was also punished by Kay. When she's upset or angry, she inexplicably mentions her secret crush on a boy named A-Xiao. In the movie, she is comforted by the Rabbit Team for this reason. Although she's sharp-tongued and full of cunning ideas, at heart she's a simple and somewhat silly girl with a rich personality. In the final chapter, episode 3, she falls for a high school trap, resulting in the destruction of her team's flag tank.",
