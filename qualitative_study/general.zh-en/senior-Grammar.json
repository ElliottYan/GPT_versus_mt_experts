In a race with the Oarai Women's Academy, she panicked and messed up, affecting the morale of her teammates. Taking advantage of a loophole in the rules, she secretly used a spy balloon to eavesdrop on information, but was backfired on, causing the whole team to lose the advantage and lose the battle. She was punished by Kaye for that. When she is sad or angry, she would inexplicably mention the boy she has a crush on (Takashi), and is consoled by the Bunny Team for this reason in the theatrical version. She is a tough talker and is always full of ideas. She is just a girl with a rich character and a silly personality. In the 3rd episode of the final chapter, she falls for the Continuation High School's trap, which leads to the destruction of the flag car she is in.",
