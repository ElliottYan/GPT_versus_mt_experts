While the chart performance of singles on the Hot 100 typically depends on streaming and airplay, that of \"Butter\" was notably driven mostly by sales (the bulk of which came from BTS' webstore, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and by fan-led crowdfunding efforts (including using money collected from fans worldwide on services like PayPal to make purchases that count toward US sales only). However, an article in The Korea Times pushed back against claims of chart manipulation. It opined that fanbases of other artists such as Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande have employed similar promotional measures, such measures were neither illegal nor unethical, and fans engaged in those measures were merely \"intelligent consumers leading global trends\".",
