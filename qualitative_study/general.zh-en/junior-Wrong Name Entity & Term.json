        "hyp": "文 2 : General Konev, now aware of the German breakout, resolved to keep his promise to Stalin not to let the German forces escape. The Soviet Intelligence, however, at this stage vastly overestimated the armored strength of the III Panzer Corps, and Konev therefore proceeded in force. At this time, the tank brigade of the 20th Tank Corps brought the new Joseph Stalin to the Korsun battlefield. Konev ordered all available armor and artillery to attack the escaping units, cutting them into isolated groups and then destroying them piecemeal. The two blocking Soviet rifle divisions, the 206th Rifle and 5th Guards Airborne, had been smashed by the German assault forces. Without infantry support, the Soviet tanks then fired into the German formations from a distance. With no anti-tank weapons in the field, T-34s commenced to wade into support troops, headquarters units, stragglers and Red-Cross identified medical columns.",
