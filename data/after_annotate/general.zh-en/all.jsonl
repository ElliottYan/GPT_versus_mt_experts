In a race with the Oarai Women's Academy, she panicked and messed up, affecting the morale of her teammates. Taking advantage of a loophole in the rules, she secretly used a spy balloon to eavesdrop on information, but was backfired on, causing the whole team to lose the advantage and lose the battle. She was punished by Kaye for that. When she is sad or angry, she would inexplicably mention the boy she has a crush on (Takashi), and is consoled by the Bunny Team for this reason in the theatrical version.

During the match against Oarai Girls Academy, her panicked and flustered behavior disrupted her teammates' morale.

She was also punished by Kay. When she's upset or angry, she inexplicably mentions her secret crush on a boy named A-Xiao. In the movie, she is comforted by the Rabbit Team for this reason.

Today, there are still the ruins of the ancient city, but the fate of the remnants remains unknown.

Today, some people living in Wutai (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) are claiming to be the descendants of the Karisi. In addition, the Dalapathan (also known as \"Druluane\" or \"Lulan\"), the descendant of Peleng, led the tribe to win the war, and was therefore known as the \"Military Leader\", exclusively owning Omomos (meaning \"easily foggy\"), the highest place of the Kucapungane. As a result, there were two major head families, i.e. the Dalapathan family, and the original head family—Kadrangilan family. \n 译文 2 : After the fall of the Palhalhivolo Tribe, its territory became the Kucapungane people's base to plant coarse cereals. Today, the remnants of the relevant ancient city can still be observed here. However, no one knows the whereabouts of the tribe's remaining people. On the other hand, although the Kala-lhilhisane Tribe was independent again and rebuilt their home, it was still destroyed by a rainstorm-caused landslide and a heavy flood. Now, only some of the people living in the Wutai Tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) call themselves the descendants of the Kala-lhilhisane Tribe. As Dalapathan (also known as Druluane, transliterated as Lu Luan and reputed as the leader with military merits), a descendant of Peleng, led his tribe to win the war, he occupied Omomos (a place with a high possibility of seeing fog), the highest site of the old Kucapungane tribe, alone. Together with Kadrangilan, the original chieftain family, they are listed as the Two Chieftain Families. \n 译文 3 : After the collapse of the Babylonian empire, the tribe settled in the northern part of the country, where they settled in the area of the present-day city of Bukhara, where they settled in the area of the present-day city of Bukhara, where they settled in the area of the present-day city of Bukhara, where they settled in the area of Bukhara. \n 译文 4 : After the fall of the Balaliulu tribe, their location became a place where the people of the Haocha tribe cultivated miscellaneous grains.

Interestingly, some people from the present-day Wutai Tribe, located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township, refer to themselves as descendants of the Rukai tribe. The Dalapathan family, also known as Druluane, traces their ancestry back to Peleng. They are renowned for their leadership in winning the battle and are honored as the military chieftain.

While the chart performance of singles on the Hot 100 typically depends on streaming and airplay, that of \"Butter\" was notably driven mostly by sales (the bulk of which came from BTS' webstore, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and by fan-led crowdfunding efforts (including using money collected from fans worldwide on services like PayPal to make purchases that count toward US sales only). However, an article in The Korea Times pushed back against claims of chart manipulation.

Today, there are still the ruins of the ancient city, but the fate of the remnants remains unknown. Although the Karisi (the Rukai people) regained independence and rebuilt their homes, it was finally destructed by a landslide and flood caused by a heavy rain. Today, some people living in Wutai (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) are claiming to be the descendants of the Karisi. In addition, the Dalapathan (also known as \"Druluane\" or \"Lulan\"), the descendant of Peleng, led the tribe to win the war, and was therefore known as the \"Military Leader\", exclusively owning Omomos (meaning \"easily foggy\"), the highest place of the Kucapungane. As a result, there were two major head families, i.e. the Dalapathan family, and the original head family—Kadrangilan family. \n 译文 2 : After the fall of the Palhalhivolo Tribe, its territory became the Kucapungane people's base to plant coarse cereals. Today, the remnants of the relevant ancient city can still be observed here. However, no one knows the whereabouts of the tribe's remaining people. On the other hand, although the Kala-lhilhisane Tribe was independent again and rebuilt their home, it was still destroyed by a rainstorm-caused landslide and a heavy flood. Now, only some of the people living in the Wutai Tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) call themselves the descendants of the Kala-lhilhisane Tribe. As Dalapathan (also known as Druluane, transliterated as Lu Luan and reputed as the leader with military merits), a descendant of Peleng, led his tribe to win the war, he occupied Omomos (a place with a high possibility of seeing fog), the highest site of the old Kucapungane tribe, alone. Together with Kadrangilan, the original chieftain family, they are listed as the Two Chieftain Families. \n 译文 3 : After the collapse of the Babylonian empire, the tribe settled in the northern part of the country, where they settled in the area of the present-day city of Bukhara, where they settled in the area of the present-day city of Bukhara, where they settled in the area of the present-day city of Bukhara, where they settled in the area of Bukhara. \n 译文 4 : After the fall of the Balaliulu tribe, their location became a place where the people of the Haocha tribe cultivated miscellaneous grains. Even today, one can still see the ancient ruins, but the whereabouts of the survivors are completely unknown. On the other hand, the Kalixi tribe, although they regained independence and rebuilt their homeland, also perished under a landslide and great flood caused by a torrential rain. Only in the present-day Wutai tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) are there some people who claim to be descendants of the Kalixi. Additionally, because he led the tribe to victory in war, the descendants of Boleng, the Dalapathan family (also known as Druluane or transliterated as \"Lulan\"), are also called \"military merit chiefs.\" They uniquely occupy the highest part of the old Haocha tribe's territory, Omomos (meaning \"prone to fog\"), and are considered one of the two major chieftain families alongside the original chieftain family, the Kadrangilan. \n 译文 5 : After the fall of Palhalhivolo, their land was taken over by the Kucapungane tribe for agricultural purposes. Although there are still visible remains of their settlement today, no one knows the whereabouts of these remnants. In a similar fate, the Rukai tribe, despite regaining their independence and rebuilding their community, met their demise due to a devastating landslide and a destructive flood triggered by heavy rainfall. Interestingly, some people from the present-day Wutai Tribe, located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township, refer to themselves as descendants of the Rukai tribe. The Dalapathan family, also known as Druluane, traces their ancestry back to Peleng. They are renowned for their leadership in winning the battle and are honored as the military chieftain. They take exclusive possession of Omomos (literally a misty place), a peak formerly held by the Old Kucapungane tribe.

{"id":1708,"text":"原文 : 《告示牌》杂志在2021年8月发表的一篇文章中指出：该团体的歌迷“透过光明正大的手段”来钻排行榜的漏洞，在美国提升了< Butter >等单曲的排名，帮助歌曲连续数周在百大单曲榜名列前茅；虽然百大单曲榜的榜单表现通常取决于串流媒体和播放，但< Butter >的榜单表现主要来自销售推动（其中大部分来自防弹少年团的线上商店，它允许粉丝购买一首歌曲的多份副本，与iTunes不同）和粉丝主导的众筹活动（包括使用从全球粉丝群众募资在PayPal等服务上进行仅计入美国销售额的购买） ；然而，《韩国时报》的一篇文章反驳了有关排行榜操纵的说法，它认为小贾斯汀和爱莉安娜·格兰德等其他歌手的粉丝群也采取了类似的促销措施，这些措施既不违法也不不道德，参与这些措施的粉丝仅仅是“引领全球趋势的智能消费者”。 \n 译文 1 : An article published by the Billboard in August 2021 pointed out that the band's fans have \"through above-board means\" taken advantage of loopholes in chart tabulations to boost the ranks of singles such as \"Butter\" in the US and help the song top the Hot 100 for multiple weeks. While the chart performance of singles on the Hot 100 typically depends on streaming and airplay, that of \"Butter\" was notably driven mostly by sales (the bulk of which came from BTS' webstore, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and by fan-led crowdfunding efforts (including using money collected from fans worldwide on services like PayPal to make purchases that count toward US sales only). However, an article in The Korea Times pushed back against claims of chart manipulation. It opined that fanbases of other artists such as Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande have employed similar promotional measures, such measures were neither illegal nor unethical, and fans engaged in those measures were merely \"intelligent consumers leading global trends\". \n 译文 2 : An article published by Billboard magazine in August 2021 noted that the group's fans \"exploited chart loopholes through legitimate means\" to boost the rankings of singles like <Butter> in the United States, helping the song to remain at the top of the Hot 100 chart for several consecutive weeks. Although chart performance on the Hot 100 is usually dependent on streaming and airplay, the chart success of <Butter> was primarily driven by sales (most of which came from BTS's online store, which allows fans to purchase multiple copies of a single song, unlike iTunes) and fan-led crowdfunding campaigns (including purchases made with funds raised from the global fan community through services like PayPal, which only count towards US sales). However, an article from The Korea Times countered the claims of chart manipulation, arguing that fans of other artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande have also engaged in similar promotional tactics, which are neither illegal nor unethical. The fans participating in these activities are simply \"smart consumers leading global trends.\" \n 译文 3 : An articled published in the Billboard in August 2021 noted: The fans of BTS exploited an advantage concerning the billboard \"in an aboveboard way\" to promote the rankings of BTS's singles including Butter in the United States, listing them in the first group of the Top 100 for weeks. Although the list of Top 100 Singles usually depends on the streaming media and amount of playing, the ranking of Butter is primarily based on the sales (mostly via BTS's online store, which, different from iTunes, allows fans to purchase multiple copies of a song) and fan-led crowdfunding activities (including using fund raised from global fans to make purchases that are only taken into account in American sales via PayPal and the like services).
