Instead of using the traditional sealing film, it has drawn on the experience of many European and American models. That is, it uses a single piece of plastic panel to cover the door, with some holes designed in it to allow for the passage of wiring harnesses without compromising the seal. This is certainly a commendable feature. \n 译文 2 : The door sealing method of the Mazda Ruiyi is different from many Japanese models.

This method is praiseworthy as it ensures effective sealing. \n 译文 3 : The door sealing method of Mazda 6 is different from that of many Japanese brands. Instead of the traditional sealing film, it learns from many European and American models. To be specific, the door is covered by a plastic plate, on which there are some perforations for the harness to pass through, without any damage to the sealing. This is a merit worth affirmation. \n 译文 4 : It's not the same as many Japanese cars, and it doesn't use traditional sealing membranes, but it draws on the experience of many European and American models, which is to cover the car door with a whole piece of plastic plate, design some holes in it, so that the wires can pass through, and there will be no sealing problems, this is definitely worth it. \n 译文 5 : Ruiyi's door sealing method is different from that of many Japanese vehicles.
